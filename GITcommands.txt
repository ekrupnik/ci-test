Branch Management
===================

    git branch new_version        # Create a new branch of development
    git checkout new_version      # Switch to the new branch
    git merge new_version         # Merge the changes from new_version into the master branch
    git diff                      # If there's any conflicts with the merge, they'll show up here
    git commit                    # Commit the merge!
    gitk                          # Shows a representation of the merge
    git branch -d new_version     # Delete the other branch, and ensure that the branch changes were merged
    git branch -D stupid_version  # Delete a branch forever
    git status                    # Show summary of pending commits

Collaborative Commands

    git branch -a                                       # Show all branches including hidden branches(which are usually stored in origin/[branch name]
    git pull /path/to/some_other_project new_version    # Pull changes from an existing git repository and merge them into a branch
    git fetch /path/to/some_other_project master        # Pull changes from an existing repository without merging
    git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD                         # Check the get log for differences between current version and fetched version
    gitk HEAD..FETCH_HEAD                               # Nice visual representation between the two
    git remote add some_other_project /path/other_proj  # Define a remote repository shortcut, stored in some_other_project/master
    git fetch some_other_project                        # Import changes from remote repository
    git merge some_other_project/master                 # Merge changes
